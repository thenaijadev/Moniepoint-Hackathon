A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This is the repository to the Moniepoint DreamDevs Hackathon question.

This project SHOULD be run as Flutter web project.

The test cases should be downloaded on your local machine.

Once you run the application locally on chrome, you can then select all the txt files for the year and then wait for the application to run the analysis.

Once the analysis is complete, the results would be displayed nicely as per the requirements of the application.

Thank you Moniepoint for this opportunity and I look forword to working at moniepoint.
